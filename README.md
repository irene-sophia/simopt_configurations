# Simulation-Optimization Configurations
This repository accompanies the paper "Simulation-optimization configurations for real-time decision-making in fugitive interception". 

The optimization algorithm can be found at https://github.com/irene-sophia/Platypus

The folders _cleaned data_ and _models_ contain all software and results for: 
- Sequential Simulation Optimization (abbreviated as _seq_ in file names), solved with MIP solver CBC (https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)
- Sequential Simulation Optimization (_seq_), solved with metaheuristic Borg
- Simulation Model Optimization (abbreviated as _smo_ in file names), solved with metaheuristic Borg

Due to size limits, this repository only contains the cleaned data. For the full dataset, please contact the authors.
